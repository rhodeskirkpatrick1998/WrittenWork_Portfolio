# WrittenWork_Portfolio
Quantitative Work Portfolio from University of Oregon (I might add some undergrad work from Arizona State). Here you will find my econometrics projects as well as forecasting scripts from my work in RATS and the relevant publication form.
As I update previous work I may add economics essays/long papers as well as mathmatics projects completed in MATLAB.
